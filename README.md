## Lorenzo Crecco

I am currently a researcher at CREA-AA (Italian Research Council for Agriculture and Economics â€“ Research Center on Agriculture and Environment) and a GIS professor at the American University of Rome. My interests are in geospatial data science and open-source software development, with a research focus on utilizing big geospatial data and cloud computing to study environmental changes. Specifically, I am engaged in the analysis of spatially explicit processes at the landscape scale, such as anomalies/stress dynamics and their impact on vegetation phenology.
